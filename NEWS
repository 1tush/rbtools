version 0.2 beta 2 (21-September-2009):
	* post-review:
		* New Features:
			* Installing RBTools now installs post-review.exe on Windows.

			* Added support for posting paths of files against Perforce
			  repositories instead of change numbers. This can be used for
			  posting specific files that were already committed. Revision
			  numbers can also be specified.

			  The post-review documentation covers how to use these new
			  parameters.

			  Patch by Eric Huss.

			* Added support for --parent, --guess-summary, and
			  --guess-description for hgsubversion. Patch by Augie Fackler.

			* post-review no longer needs simplejson if using Python 2.6.

			* Added repository UUID support for git-svn. This works the same
			  way as SVN's repository UUID support. Patch by Matthew Woehlke.

			* Diffs generated for Git now contain the full SHA1s instead of
			  the shortened form, which is needed for Review Board servers
			  using GitHub or other similar services and configured with
			  raw URL support for fetching files from Git.

		* General Bugs Fixed:
			* Fix an infinite recursion problem during login with invalid
			  cookies. Patches by Eric Huss and Chris Clark. (Bug #808)

		* ClearCase Bugs Fixed:
			* Our ClearCase support no longer breaks post-review if
			  cleartool isn't installed.

			* We now generate revision strings properly with ClearCase. They
			  were missing a space, squashing parameters together.

		* Git Bugs Fixed:
			* The local repository configuration (.reviewboardrc) wasn't being
			  read with Git repositories.

		* Mercurial Bugs Fixed:
			* Fix the Mercurial support so that it doesn't assume a repository
			  is a hg-svn repository incorrectly.

		* Perforce Bugs Fixed:
			* Our Perforce support would break with files containing spaces
			  in the path. Patch by Steven Russell. (Bug #840)

			* Fix line termination issues with Perforce when files coming in
			  have \r\r\n termination. We now normalize these to \r\n.
			  This can happen in some Perforce setups when dealing with a
			  file checked out from one platform and modified on another.
			  Patch by Raghu Kaippully. (Bug #1071)

			* Changes with binary files could break the generated diffs
			  with Perforce. Patch by Chris Trimble.

			* We now mark temporary files as read/write instead of
			  write-only in the Perforce support, to prevent problems on
			  Windows. (Bug #1143)

			* gdiff (GNU diff) is now used on Solaris instead of diff when
			  using Perforce. Solaris's diff is incompatible with post-review.

		* Subversion Bugs Fixed:
			* URLs weren't always properly joined for SVN repositories on
			  Windows. Patch by Jeremy Bettis. (Bug #939)

version 0.2 beta 1 (28-March-2009):
	* Bugs Fixed in post-review:
		* The help output for --rpeository-url and the error output used for
		  when --parent isn't supported was referencing the wrong names
	      for some parameters.

		* Patches generated against a git tree were broken when running
		  post-review inside a subdirectory of the root of the tree.
		  Patch by Luke Lu. (Bug #928)

		* Fixed a parsing error when using diffs generated by Git.
		  Patch by Stacey Sheldon.

		* Removed a duplicate CVSClient class, which added to the file's
		  size and possibly caused some errors. Patch by Lepton Wu.

		* Fixed a deprecation warning when using post-review on Python 2.6.
		  Patch by Eric Huss.

		* Fixed parsing Perforce changesets that include binary files.
		  Patch by Raghu Kaippully. (Bug #585)


	* New Features in post-review:
		* Added new --guess-summary and --guess-description parameters for
		  Git repositories that provide defaults for both the summary and
		  description based on the commit messages on the branch.
		  Patch by Luke Lu. (Bug #927)

		* post-review can now look up the Review Board server URL from
		  Perforce counters. See the documentation inside post-review or on
		  the website for examples on how to set this up.
