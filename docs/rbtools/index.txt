Installation
============

Before installing RBTools, you will need to have both Python and setuptools
installed.

We require Python 2.4 or higher. We recommend installing Python 2.7. The
3.x releases will not work.


Installing Python
-----------------

Linux
~~~~~

Python 2.x should come with your distribution. If not, or if 2.x isn't
installed, you will need to install the appropriate package. Please refer to
your package manager for the appropriate version.


Windows
~~~~~~~

You can install Python by running the latest `Python 2.7 Installer`_ for
Windows. We recommend the 32-bit MSI installer, as setuptools is not packaged
for 64-bit.

Installing setuptools
---------------------

Linux
~~~~~

To install setuptools on Debian_, Ubuntu_, or another Debian-based
distribution, type::

    $ apt-get install python-setuptools


To install on Fedora_ 8 and above, type::

    $ yum install -y python-setuptools-devel.noarch

To install on a `RedHat Enterprise`_, CentOS_, Fedora_ 7 and earlier, or
another RedHat-based distribution, type::

    $ yum install python-setuptools


Users of other distributions should check with their distribution for native
packages, or follow the `setuptools installation`_ instructions.

If the version of setuptools available for your distribution is older than
0.6c9, you'll need to install it first, and then upgrade it to the latest
version by running::

    $ easy_install -U setuptools

.. _`setuptools installation`: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions


Windows
~~~~~~~

You'll then need to run the latest `Python setuptools Installer`_ (look
toward the bottom of the page for the file listing).

Once Python and setuptools are installed, you may need to add a couple
directories to your system path.

1. Open :menuselection:`Start --> Control Panel` and navigate to the
   :guilabel:`System` icon.
2. Click on the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab.
3. Click :guilabel:`Environment Variables`.
4. Find :envvar:`PATH` in :guilabel:`System variables` and click
   :guilabel:`Edit`.
5. Add ``;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts`` (substitute your Python
   directory if it's not ``C:\Python27``) to the end of the list.
